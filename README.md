This is a custom mechanical keyboard that I'm designing and building from
scratch. It will be handwired, and controlled by a teensy 2.0 using the
[tmk_keyboard] [tmk] firmware.

Layout
----

This all started from my desire to have a split keyboard that was as close to
the traditional 60% layout as possible. My first draft was something like this:

As I was looking at pricing for the various components, I realized that I could
modify the basic split 60% to pack a little more punch, and maybe even arrive
at an endgame keyboard.

Here's where I ended up:

Firmware
--------

I took the [tmk_keyboard] [tmk] firmware and modified the keymap. Navigate to
firmware to see the ugly details
